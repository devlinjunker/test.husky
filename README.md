# Githooks

Testing githooks, started with `pre-commit`, and then added script for `prepare-commit-msg`

- pre-commit: Check the commit message for spelling errors.
- pre-receive: Enforce project coding standards.
- post-commit: Email/SMS team members of a new commit.
- post-receive: Push the code to production.
